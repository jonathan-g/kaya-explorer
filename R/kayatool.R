#' @description
#'
#' A Shiny-based explorer for Kaya identity. Loads data from the kayadata package and
#' provides an interactive shiny app for exploring the data: choose a country or region and
#' examine trends in the Kaya variables (population, gross domestic product, primary energy
#' consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions), compare historical trends to the implied trends
#' necessary to hit decarbonization policy targets (e.g., 70% reduction of emissions by 2050).
#' Also allows the user to explore the fuel mix that different countries and regions use to
#' supply their energy needs.
