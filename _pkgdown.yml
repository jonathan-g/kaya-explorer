  title: Kaya Identity Data for Nations and Regions
  description: >
    A Shiny-based explorer for Kaya identity. Loads data from the kayadata
    package and provides an interactive shiny app for exploring the data:
    choose a country or region and examine trends in the Kaya variables
    (population, gross domestic product, primary energy consumption, and
    carbon dioxide emissions), compare historical trends to the implied trends
    necessary to hit decarbonization policy targets (e.g., 70% reduction of
    emissions by 2050). Also allows the user to explore the fuel mix that
    different countries and regions use to supply their energy needs.
